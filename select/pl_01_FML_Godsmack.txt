Make me lie when I open (without
even knowing)
Wasting time dragging me down
(through everything that's
broken)
Tried so hard to impress me (by
pushing up against me )
Wait for one more second so you
can still correct me
Take me, try to break me open
Why? 'cause I know something
Hate me, try to make me change
what's right
So fuck my life
Time stands still when I'm with
you (but you make me want to
kill you)
How am I supposed to break
through? (I can't even
understand you)
I don't mind watching you
crumble (for everything you do
to me )
Why do you push so hard and
constantly try to test me?
Take me, try to break me open
Why? 'cause I know something
Hate me, try to make me change
what's right
So fuck my life
Take me, try to break me open
Why? 'cause I know you hate your
life
So fuck my life
Take me, and try to break me
Hate me, fuck my life
Take me, and try to break me
Hate me, fuck my life
Take me, try to break me open
Why? 'cause I know something
Hate me, try to make me change
what's right
So fuck my life
Take me, try to break me open
Why? 'cause I know you hate your
life
So fuck my life
Take me, break me
Hate me, don't try to change me
Take me, break me, take me, hate
me, break me
Fuck my life
