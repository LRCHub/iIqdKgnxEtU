I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay
'Cause you could fall in, and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way
So come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
You look like somebody that could really hold it down
You look like somebody that would always stick around
Valentina's into you, so I know you probably crazy
All my friends said stay away but that shit just don't faze me
Got a little bit of sassy, I like that
You don't take no shit, yeah you fight back
Never let a dude hit it on the first night
I can't even sleep over 'til I wife that
All these bitches in my phone, hit the boy
But I've been curving everyone for you (brr, brr, brr)
Girl I would give you every single password
All you gotta do is let me through, yeah
I'mma keep it honest
I know that you got a pass
I know you ain't perfect
But basic bitches never last
I don't usually do this type of shit
So baby trust me when I tell you that I'm all about it
Yeah, I might fall in love and let you fuck my life up
Just so I could go and write a song about it
I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay
'Cause you could fall in, and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way
So come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Last man left, you broken hearted
Let me treat you right
Shorty if you need me I could pull up any night
You just say the words, girl I don't need a reason
Give me something more than just a lover on the weekend
I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay
'Cause you could fall in, and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way
So come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck my life up
Come and, come and, come and fuck my life up
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
