He's calling me baby
And all of his friends say he should date me
Why have you stopped calling me lately?
Feels like these days, I'm only waitin', this is crazy, oh

Got me wishin' I was takin' off clothes with you
Two weeks and I felt so close to you
What is it? What is it? Oh
Now you're so cold, tell me what I'm s'posed to do
Door closed and I'm wishin' I could go with you
What is it? What is it?

Fuck my life
I thought we were something good
Fuck my life
Never thought that one thing could
Fuck my life like this
I'm tellin' everyone about it
And you don't even care about it
I, I

I swim in the moments
And they come in waves, I'm caught in emotions, ah
And I wanna know where you going
I wanna know where you're at
Is this the way you go through the motions, the motions? Ah

Got me wishin' I was takin' off clothes with you
Two weeks and I felt so close to you
What is it? What is it? Oh
Now you're so cold, tell me what I'm s'posed to do
Door closed and I'm wishin' I could go with you
What is it? What is it?

Fuck my life
I thought we were something good
Fuck my life
Never thought that one thing could
Fuck my life like this
I'm tellin' everyone about it
And you don't even care about it

Fuck my life
Never thought that one thing could
Fuck my life like this

Tell me a way just to say that you could
Puttin' me down to make yourself look good
Keepin' me close 'cause you know that you should
I know that soon you'll be coming right back around
Fake, uh, I wanna delete your face, uh
You were just one big mistake, I, I can't believe I let you

Fuck my life
I thought we were something good
Fuck my life (yeah)
Never thought that one thing could
Fuck my life like this
I'm tellin' everyone about it
And you don't even care about it (no, no, no, no)

Fuck my life

Fuck my life like this
